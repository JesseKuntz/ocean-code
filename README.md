## Thanks
* Couldn't have done anything without this [CSS-Tricks Article](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) - thanks Sarah Drasner!
* For a long time, I used the [Dark Sea](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoOx.dark-sea) theme, but decided that I wanted a little more color - so I made this!

**Enjoy!**
